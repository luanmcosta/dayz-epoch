You may need to confirm the MySQL path for the mysqldump exe as it may depend on your provider.

Add "pause" (without "") at the end of the file to require an input for debugging.  This allows you to check the test backup is ok and troubleshoot any issues.  Remove it when automating or the .bat file will never close.  Automation can be done via Windows task scheduler.  Create a basic task and then edit the tasks parameters after creating if you want to backup more than once a day.  The option is only available after the task is created.
